	<h2>Enumeration</h2>

	<p><em>Note: I added the IP address to my /etc/hosts file, so that 'yotd' resolves to the target IP</em></p>

	<h3>Port scanning</h3>

	<p><code>
	nmap -sV -sC -v -p -oN all-ports.txt yotd
	</code> 
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/nmap-output.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/nmap-output.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>We have a web application and SSH to explore. Let's start by looking at the web app.</p>

	<h3>Web page</h3>

	<p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/main-web-page.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/main-web-page.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>
	Not too much going on here. A static html page showing a queue number. 
	Brute forcing directories did not yield anything useful.</p>

	<p>There is one cookie set by this page, <code>id</code>.
	Deleting this cookie, and revisiting the page, shows a different queue number. This cookie must be some identifier
	for the queue number for the person visiting this page. <br />
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/regular-cookie.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/regular-cookie.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>Providing a non-sense value for the cookie gives us this as a response:
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/nonsense-cookie.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/nonsense-cookie.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<h3>SQL Injection</h3>

	<p>Setting an invalid cookie value gives us an <code>Error</code> on the page! Perhaps the cookie is vulnerable to SQL injection.  </p>

	<p>After some playing around, I found a payload that would reflect on the webpage:
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/reflected-cookie.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/reflected-cookie.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>
	The SQL query asks for two columns, and displays the value returned for the second column.</p>

	<p>At this point I wrote a little python script that sends a request with a cookie we control.
	I found this to be more convenient than setting the cookie in my browser each time.</p>

	<p>We can try to abuse this SQL injection to read system files:
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/sqli-lfi.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/sqli-lfi.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>
	We got <code>/etc/passwd</code>! For now we can see that there is one non-root user with a bash shell on this machine.</p>

	<p>We were successful in <em>reading</em> server side files, now let's try to <em>write</em> to server side files.
	Hopefully we can upload a php file somewhere under the web root (<code>/var/www/html</code>)</p>

	<p>I also noticed that whenever I sent a request with a cookie that had a &lt; or &gt; character, I would get a response
	that just had the text 'RCE attempt detected'. So there must be a blacklist for cookie characters.</p>

	<p>I wanted to write php code to a file, but the php code would require &lt; and &gt; in it's content.
	I got around this by base64 encoding my php code, and the using SQL's FROM_BASE64() function to take a base64 encoded string.
	This got me around the blacklist.</p>

	<p>The below script uploads a php file that takes a GET parameter, and runs it as a system command, giving us remote code execution.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/sqli-fileupload.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/sqli-fileupload.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>We can then visit <code>http://yotd/shell.php</code> in our browser, and set the <code>c</code> GET parameter to any command we want to execute on the target machine.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/rce.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/rce.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<h3>Getting a web shell</h3>

	<p>With RCE, the first order of business is to upload a webshell. On my host machine, I spun up a python http server, and then using
	RCE, I called <code>wget</code> to retrieve a php reverse shell from my host machine.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/upload-webshell.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/upload-webshell.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>I then used netcat to listen for TCP connections, and by visiting <code>http://yotd/revshell.php</code> in my browser, I was able to run the revshell php code.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/catching-web-shell.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/catching-web-shell.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>I started enumerating the system, and I came across a readable file in <code>/home/dylan</code>
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/dylan-files.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/dylan-files.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<h3>Finding leaked credentials</h3>

	<p>Searching through the file <code>work_analysis</code>, I observed that this was some sort of log for sshd authentication attempts.
	Users frequently make the mistake of entering their password along with their username (perhaps they forgot to hit the tab key).</p>

	<p>Searching for 'dylan' in this file revealed that dylan had made this mistake and his password appeared in plaintext.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/leaked-creds.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/leaked-creds.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/ssh-loggedin.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/ssh-loggedin.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<h3>Further Enumeration</h3>

	<p>When enumerating this machine, there were a couple things that stood out:
	<ul>
		
	<li>This machine was running a docker container with some service running on port 3000</li>
	<li>There was a <code>/gitea</code> directory, and dylan was the owner of almost all of the files</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/docker-running.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/docker-running.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>I was unfamiliar with gitea prior to this box, but in summary, it is a git service that one could host on their machine.
	The docker container was running gitea on port 3000.</p>

	<p>Port 3000 was not accessible from a remote connection. It was only accessible from the <strong>year-of-the-dog</strong> host.
	I forwarded port 3000 using ssh:</p>
	<pre><code>ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 dylan@yotd</code></pre>

	<p>I could then visit <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in my browser and I got the gitea web application.</p>

	<p>There was one user on this gitea instance, dylan. I registered my own account and created a repository.</p>

	<p>My repository git files were located at <code>/gitea/git/repositories/test/asdf.git</code> (my username was test, and the repo was named asdf)</p>

	<p>Althought gitea was running in a docker container, there must have been a shared volume for <code>/gitea</code>!
	Dylan had ownership for most of these files likely because dylan shared a UID with the user on the docker container who owned these files.</p>

	<p>This means we have some control over the gitea instance running in the docker container. Maybe we can break into the docker container...</p>

	<p>Searching through the files under <code>/gitea/git/repositories/test/asdf.git</code>, there was a hooks directory that contained bash scripts that
	would run based on certain events. For example, there was a script named <code>pre-receive</code> which would run whenever a <code>push</code> was made to the repository.</p>

	<p>I modified the <code>pre-receive</code> script to contain a line that would run <code>/bin/sh</code> on port 5555 of <strong>year-of-the-dog</strong>.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/modified-hook.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/modified-hook.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>I opened up a netcat listener to catch the tcp connection, and pushed a change to my repository:
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/docker-shell.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/docker-shell.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>
	I caught the shell and now I'm in the docker container!</p>

	<p>The <code>git</code> user could run any command as root, so I switched to root. As root I can set permissions
	for any file. This is really powerful when we consider the fact that this docker container has a shared volume with <strong>year-of-the-dog</strong> !</p>

	<p>I exited the shell, and on <strong>year-of-the-dog</strong> I copied over <code>/bin/bash</code> to <code>/gitea/gitea</code>.
	Then I made another push to the repository, so I could trigger the hook script, so I could catch the shell from the docker container.</p>

	<p>As root on the docker container, I set the ownership of <code>bash</code> to be owned by root, and I also set the SUID bit so that this executable could be run
	with root privileges.
	</p>
	<a href="../images/thm-dog/setting-permissions.png" />
	<img class="blog-img" src="../images/thm-dog/setting-permissions.png" alt="png" title="" />
	</a>

	<p>With the bash SUID created, I exited the docker shell, and as user dylan I ran <code>./bash -p</code> giving me a root shell.
	</p>
